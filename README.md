### TEAM NAME
**STHANDARD MUTH**

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Displaced, adopted, or moved individuals often struggle to trace their ancestry. Traditional methods are time-consuming and not always reliable. Our goal is to provide a more accessible and AI-powered tool for ancestry search.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
We built an **Ancestry Searcher** that uses DuckDuckGo’s API to retrieve the top 5 relevant results, which are processed by Meta’s LLaMA for refined ancestry insights. An interactive chatbot powered by Amazon Q guides users through the search and helps interpret results.
